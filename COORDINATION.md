# COORDINATION.md — shared task board

This file is the coordination mechanism for all agent sessions working on `kanlerxz87-cyber/NFL2`.
Read it before touching anything. Claim work before you start it. Never edit files inside another session's scope.

- **Board owner:** whichever session is currently integrating.
- **Session ID convention:** short id from the branch name (`arena/<id>-<repo>` → `<id>`).
- **Stale claim rule:** a claim older than 60 minutes with no commits may be taken over; record the handoff in the Log below.
- **Statuses:** `unclaimed` · `in progress` · `done` · `needs review`
- **`needs review`** means the item is published on the *Flagged for Review* page and does not block other sessions.

## Repo review (as of session `bc4b47cf`, 2026-11-12)

| Fact | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Files tracked | 1 — `README.md` (6 bytes, contents: `# NFL2`) |
| Commits on `main` | 1 — `01f2271 Initial commit` |
| Code / data / config / docs | none present |
| Requirements document | **absent** — no `REQUIREMENTS.md`, no spec, no issue tracker content in repo |
| GitHub Pages | already configured: `legacy` build, source branch `main`, path `/` → https://kanlerxz87-cyber.github.io/NFL2/ |
| Consequence | the site must be buildable from the repo root (`index.html` at root); the requirements register is reconstructed from the project brief in `data/requirements.csv` |

## Rules of engagement

1. **Claim before editing.** Write your session id + file scope in the row, `git commit && git push` the claim, then start.
2. **Non-overlapping scope.** One task = one branch `session-<id>/<task>` (or a worktree). Touch only files in your claimed scope.
3. **Requests across scopes.** If you need to change a file owned by another session, add a row to *Change requests* below; do not edit it.
4. **Small, frequent commits.** `git pull --rebase` before every push.
5. **Conflicts.** Stop, resolve without discarding the other session's work, record it in *Log*.
6. **Finish line.** Record sources, verification performed, and irregularities here, then mark the task `done`.
7. **Never mark verified without an official source link.** Unconfirmable values stay blank and get a row in `data/flags.csv`.
8. **Shared outputs** (table data, site index/nav) are only touched by the final integration session.

## Log

| # | UTC | Session | Event |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2026-11-12 04:3x | `bc4b47cf` | Repo review: single 6-byte README, no code/data; claimed T1–T18 (sole session so far) |
| 2 | 2026-11-12 04:4x | `bc4b47cf` | Pulled official Week 10 injury report (nfl.com/injuries/, 7 chunks), standings (2 chunks), week-10 status article, Wed 11-Nov roundup (4 chunks) |
| 3 | 2026-11-12 04:4x | `bc4b47cf` | Bash egress to nfl.com blocked by sandbox allowlist → all external data obtained through the fetch/search tools; recorded as a constraint in `data/questions.csv` (Q-24) |
| 4 | 2026-11-12 05:0x | `bc4b47cf` | Audit caught 3 real defects before publishing: (a) 6 shifted rows in `suggestions.csv` + 5 in `requirements.csv` (short rows silently moving columns) → strict field-count check added to the builder and `verify.py`; (b) my own prose said "5 designations" and "9 injury cells" where the data says 6 and 6 → corrected at every occurrence; (c) `nfl.com` player-slug/name mismatches enumerated and turned into FL-15 rather than silently "fixed" |
| 5 | 2026-11-12 05:1x | `bc4b47cf` | CI `build-and-audit` failed on the drift step. Root cause: a `tools/__pycache__/*.pyc` file had been committed by an earlier `git add -A` and `check_site.py` rewrote it. Fix: `.gitignore` for bytecode, `git rm --cached`, `sys.dont_write_bytecode` in the auditor, and the build made byte-deterministic (no wall-clock stamp in any page). Verified by a clean `git clone` + rebuild + `git diff --cached` showing nothing |
| 6 | 2026-11-12 05:2x | `bc4b47cf` | Final state before PR: `tools/verify.py` 29 pass / 0 warn / 0 fail; `tools/check_site.py` 8 pass / 1 warn (non-league hosts appear only on the Source Registry, by design) / 0 fail; 22 HTML pages, 588 blank cells rendered as `not published` |

## Verification record (T2–T5)

Sources used, all fetched 2026-11-12 (UTC) from the official league site:

| Data | Official URL | Verification performed | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Week 10 practice-snapshot injury report (254 player rows) | https://www.nfl.com/injuries/ | Row-by-row transcription from the rendered official tables; each row keeps the official player link; participation strings kept verbatim | 254 rows verified against the official page text; **injury column blank wherever the official table left it blank** (246 of 254) |
| Week 10 game status (Out / Questionable) | https://www.nfl.com/injuries/ and https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-10-injury-report-2026-season | Cross-checked the two official pages; the article lists designations only for the 12-Nov and 15-Patriots cases | 6 designations confirmed (5 Out + 1 Questionable); Sunday/Monday designations **not yet published at fetch time** → flagged |
| 2026 standings (32 teams, W/L/T, PF/PA, streak) | https://www.nfl.com/standings/ | Both chunks transcribed; win % and net points recomputed locally and compared to the published columns | 32/32 rows recomputed clean |
| Week 10 schedule (14 games: date, kickoff, venue, TV) | https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-10-injury-report-2026-season | Schedule block of the official article vs. the official injuries page header | 14/14 games agree |
| Depth-chart / IR / roster moves (Wed 11-Nov) | https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-news-roundup-latest-league-updates-from-wednesday-nov-11 | 4 chunks, transcribed per team | 3 confirmed QB changes + 1 unresolved + 1 backup assignment, 13 designated-to-return, 1 activated off IR, 6 ruled-out statements, plus signings and cuts |

### Irregularities found (published on *Flagged for Review*, not blocking)

| # | Irregularity | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Official injury page shows **“No Injuries Reported” for Seattle** on 15-Nov, yet the same official news page reports Darnold ruled out and 12 Seahawks participants with injuries. | https://www.nfl.com/injuries/ vs https://www.nfl.com/news/sam-darnold-ruled-out-for-seahawks-week-10-game-vs-raiders-drew-lock-expected-to-start-again |
| 2 | Third-party sites publish game statuses (Nacua *Out*, Jacobs *Out*) that the official page does not carry at fetch time — timing difference, not a data conflict, but it shows why third-party "official-looking" tables must not be used as the system of record. | https://www.nfl.com/injuries/ vs https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/2026-11-10/nfl-injury-report-week-10/ |
| 3 | Roster-movement volume this season is extreme (Garrett on LAR, Parsons on GB, Evans on SF, Watson on CLE, Jacobs on GB, etc.). Every row was transcribed as published and **not** corrected, but the roster-join keys need an official 53-man roster pull before any team-level model uses them. | https://www.nfl.com/teams/new-england-patriots/roster |
| 4 | The 2026 roster-manual mechanics (4-game IR minimum, 8 return designations, 21-day window) could only be found on non-official sites; the NFL Football Operations landing page does not expose them in a fetchable rule page. Marked **unverified against an official source**. | https://operations.nfl.com/ |
| 5 | `nfl.com/teams/<slug>/depth-chart/` returns a 404 page — there is **no official public depth chart** at that path, so "2nd/3rd/4th-string replacement" cannot be derived from an official depth chart; it must be derived from the roster list + injury report + game reports. | https://www.nfl.com/teams/new-england-patriots/depth-chart/ |
| 6 | Market data (closing/opening lines, prop prices) has no official NFL endpoint reachable from this sandbox; the sandbox blocks egress outside an allowlist. Line-origination therefore ships as a **spec**, not a fitted model. | tool-level observation, recorded in `data/flags.csv` |

### No-conflict statement

At the time of this integration there are **no other active sessions** on this repo: `git branch -r` shows only `origin/main`, and the task board above is the only claim record. Nothing was merged, discarded, or overwritten from another session.
